# django_log

## 08/10/21 - uploaded some test code

logging complete with stack trace and local vars to be called from anywhere

The idea here is to create a standalone django app that can be used for creating logs as well as rotating them.

To do:
- set up project, simplify to app later
- set up rotations for each log and allow that to be adjusted from admin panel
- create a separate panel that will allow a user who has admin permissions to view log files
- maybe set custom log permissions that can be added for each user
